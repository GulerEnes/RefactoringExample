# RefactoringExample
It is an example for refactoring a spagetti code, that runs perfectly, to high-quality code.

Develop a Java project which stores foods and recipes of these foods. Each recipe will contain items (i.e. item type, unit â€“ kg or liter, amount, calories, cooking description). There will be functionalities such as listing the foods, getting total calorie or displaying the content/recipe of the food. You will develop a console application for the sake of simplicity.



Challange:
1. Develop a spaghetti (low-quality) code, that runs perfectly
2. Demonstrate the functionalities of your code in the main method
3. Refactor your low-quality code and keep notes
